## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Voltix is a multichain Threshold-Signature vault that does not need any specialised hardware. It supports most UTXO, EVM, BFT and EdDSA Chains.
It is based on [go-tss](https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/master).

Voltix is built by the founders of THORChain - who built the largest and oldest working multi-chain DEX with Threshold-signatures. 

Create a vault:
* 2 of 2 (fastest setup, not backed up)
* 2 of 3 (recommended, backed up)
* 3 of 4 (most secure)

🔮 Threshold-Sig Vaults are better than Single-Sig or Multi-sig Wallets:
1) If you leak or lose a single-sig wallet, you can lose everything
2) There is no on-chain registration of signing-keys (such as Bitcoin or EVM Multi-sigs)
3) Threshold-Sigs are compatible on all chains (Multi-sigs are not)
4) Threshold-Sigs are fully DeFi compatible (Multi-sigs are not)

📱 Voltix uses your favourite Laptops, Tablets and Phones. 
1) Rich, large screens with familiar UI
2) Secure Enclaves to store vault shares, with biometric locking. 
3) Does not look a hardware device (not a honeypot)

🌈 Voltix is open-source, based on secure technology and is audited (link soon). There is no registration required.
